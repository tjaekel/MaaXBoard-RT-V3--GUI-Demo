# MaaXBoard-RT-Demo

## Remark
This project is the AVNET "out-of-the-box" demo for the MaaXBoard-RT.
It has some small fixes to get rid of compile and project warnings.

## Attention
The file "board.h" here is the latest version:
It has support for all three LEDs, but the ON/OFF definition seems to be flipped.
